# Privacy

Altis is committed to prividing frameworks, tooling and, where possible, integrations with other modules and platforms to enable customers to build privacy-first solutions.

Privacy is a core capabiliity for the modern web and something every customer and project has to deal with. Right now, a diverse array of solutions are available for web applications, and each requires custom integration work to get the most out of them.

Altis provides a consistent method for dealing with acquiring consent, managing user data and documenting privacy measures. In addition, we integrate and provide the controls for managing privacy in Altis' built-in features including analytics, personalization and Google Tag Manager.

Privacy is provided within Altis as a first-class component.
